# Experiment specification

The authoritative specifications are the seven named JSON files in `configs/`. Each contains the full paper target, methods, budgets, warmup, thinning, optimization, seeds, quantile levels, and output basename. `presets.json` lists explicit quick and affordable-reproduction overrides. Use `python run_experiment.py IDENTIFIER --preset paper --dry-run` to inspect the exact resolved input.

[README.md](../README.md) contains the catalogue. [RERUN.md](RERUN.md) maps each configuration to manuscript figures and the posterior table. [TARGETS.md](TARGETS.md) defines every density and coordinate transform, and [REPRODUCIBILITY.md](REPRODUCIBILITY.md) defines timing and metrics.

`experiments/` and `run_*.py` are compatibility entry points. They call the same implementation in `dcs_bench/`; there are no separate target copies to repair.
